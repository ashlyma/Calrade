## inspiration

Our classmates at our school were the inspiration for this app. Everytime our teacher assigns a quiz our classmates tend to, always finish it in time. Later on, they start asking the teacher for their test scores. Once they get their test scores, they ask "Is that a B or an A?" for their grade and ect. We proposed a solution to this problem with our limited coding skills: an app that could calculate your grade after receiving you score. This would make it easier not only for our teacher but for our classmates as well. That way they won't have to wait a long time to get their grade. 

## What it does

This app calculates your final grade by dividing the amount of points the quiz or work is worth by the score you got once you finished your quiz or your test. Moreover, not only does it calculate the percentage of your grade, it also shows you the letter of your grade! That way you know what to expect your grade to be. This is a quicker way to know your score since it does it right away! There's also a reset button to start from scratch entering your information. Another feature that makes our grade calculator different from other's are the sound effects once you get your grade. 

## How we built it

We built this app with the little knowledge of JavaScript that Iwe have on the Code.org platform! We started off creating variables that store the score you got, the amount of points the work was worth and the result after both are divided. Then, we assigned variables so it gets the input from the user and stores it in the score, points and result variables. We used the division operator to calculate the percentage of your grade. And we had an If statement (Just control), setText and setProperty UI controls to display the correct letter based off your grade percentage. It also helps determine which is sound effect- that will be played once you get your result because it is based on your grade. Finally, the last segment of the code is the reset button which resets all the information the user had put in all areas, and plays a sound effect when clicked and plays a different sound depending on the grade.

## Challenges we ran into

Since we started programming not long ago, it was hard to understand what we were supposed to do next. We got many bugs and had trouble figuring out how to do certain things. We had to review the library and the syntaxes and helped each other throughout the process. We had to study and practice in our own in order to understand what we were doing and how to do our parts quickly. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of how far we came. We never expected to get our app to turn out like this, it was better then we expected. We are so proud for all the things we were taught to create a game like this! We hope this app can help the staff and student's at school get their grades quickly in a funny way! (Because of the sound effects of each grade) We hope they find it helpful and use it often instead of having to wait some time for your turn, so your teacher can tell your grade. 

## What we learned

We have learned how to use JavaScript in an non -complex way that helped understand further for future making complex projects. For example, we learned the importance of comments when coding. This helps a person who is looking at your code understand what is going on. Another example are libraries, they very helpful! If you know multiple coding languages or just haven't coded in a long period of time, libraries are your friend. They helped us so much in the making process of our app. We used to forget how a couple of syntaxes were supposed to be written.

## What's next for Calrade

We would like to expand more by making our platform a full well-developed website. With that done we would like to add features such as being a able to sign up for an account and store your information. Not only do we want to stay with that, we also want to be able to create some sort of spreadsheet that will help teacher's calculate their student's grades in an more faster efficient way!
